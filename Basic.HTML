            Someone who is a true friend stands up for you. When others try to hurt you emotionally or physically, they do everything they can to make sure you stay safe. They don't care who is trying to harm you; they will defend you anytime, anywhere. If they can help you, they'll do it without reservation or reward.

A true friend is not one who repeatedly is telling you negative things other people say about you. First, they make it clear by their words and by their actions where they stand when it comes to you. Secondly, they don't just merely standby silently when others are tearing you down no matter what consequences they may face socially.

A true friend is a friend when it is convenient and when it is not. They standby you consistently both when you are present and when you are not.

          How to Know Your True Friends
         </h2>
         <p>
          A true friend acknowledges your feelings but at the same time points you towards a happier, healthier life. A true friend is not complacent in your personal growth, they don't passively sit by and watch you make choices that are not good for you. They want to see the happiest and healthiest version of you. They encourage you to make the choice that will get you want you want in life. They learn the art of being your biggest cheerleader while holding you accountable to your goals as well.
